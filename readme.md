netlify-git-api users add
netlify-git-api serve
```

Open a separate terminal window and run:

```bash
npm install
roots watch
```

## Using

Visit [localhost:1111](http://localhost:1111/) to browser the site.

Visit [localhost:1111/admin](http://localhost:1111/admin) to use the CMS.

To run against the GitHub API in production, edit the production backend settings for `admin/config.yml` with the correct repository and branch...
